# Readable Project

This is an application that allows user to create posts, comment on these posts, vote on comments and posts, edit comments and posts, sort posts by vote score or date of original post.

A note is that data is presistant but has no authenitcation so any "user" can create any post/comment, edit any post/comment, with any username, even ones that already exist.

## Start Using

To get started right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, use Create React App to scaffold out the front-end
    - `create-react-app frontend`
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
